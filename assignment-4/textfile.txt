Java, my heart, you've stolen away,
With every compile and each new array.
From 'Hello, World' to methods that flow,
You've made my heart race, you've helped me grow.

Your syntax, precise, in braces you bind,
With loops and conditions, our souls intertwined.
Each class and object, a love to extend,
Inheritance deep, like a true lifelong friend.

Oh, Java, dear love, I'd catch every Exception,
For each NullPointer you throw in my direction.
To debug our love, I would break every line,
For your logic, dear Java, will always be mine.

Though errors may come, and stack traces may call,
With you, dear Java, I'll follow the dream.
Together we'll code, forever we'll be,
In a world built by us, in pure binary.
